                  1. What is the stock screener, and how does it work? <span>+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                  A stock screener is a tool that helps investors filter stocks based on specific criteria or parameters like price, market capitalization, earnings, technical indicators, and more. It works by applying these filters to a database of stocks, displaying only those that match the user's selected criteria. This helps investors quickly identify stocks that align with their investment strategy.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                  Some common parameters include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Market Cap: Filters stocks based on company size (e.g., large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap).</li>
                    <li>Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Helps identify undervalued or overvalued stocks.</li>
                    <li>Earnings Per Share (EPS): Indicates a company's profitability.</li>
                    <li>Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: Helps identify if a stock is over or underpriced relative to its book value.</li>
                    <li>Dividend Yield: Selects stocks based on dividend payouts.</li>
                    <li>Beta: Measures a stock's volatility relative to the market.</li>

                  3. How do I customize the filters in the stock screener? <span>+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                  You can customize the filters by selecting specific criteria from a list of available options. Each filter will allow you to set a range (e.g., a P/E ratio between 10 and 20, or a dividend yield above 3%). You can combine multiple filters to refine your search and find stocks that meet your specific investment needs.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                  Yes, a stock screener can be tailored to find both growth and value stocks. For growth stocks, you might filter for companies with strong earnings growth, high revenue growth, or high price momentum. For value stocks, you might look for low P/E ratios, high dividend yields, or stocks trading below book value.

                <div class="answer">
                  While the stock screener provides data based on the selected parameters, it is important to perform additional research before making any investment decisions. The screener is only a tool to help narrow down options, and factors like market conditions, company fundamentals, and news events can affect a stockâ€™s performance.

                <div class="answer">
                  Yes, this stock screener combines both fundamental and technical data. Fundamental filters look at financial metrics like P/E ratio, debt levels, and earnings growth, while technical filters focus on stock price behavior and market trends. Using both types of data can provide a more comprehensive view of a stock's potential.

                  Yes, stock screeners can be used by all types of investors.

                <div class="answer">
                  Yes, you can set filters for metrics like Beta (which measures volatility) and debt-to-equity ratios to help select stocks that align with your risk tolerance. A high Beta value suggests a more volatile stock, while a lower Beta indicates less risk.
